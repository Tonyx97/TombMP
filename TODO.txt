- General bugs, issues and new features:
	· Load/unload of audios when starting/stopping a resource that register them.
	· Fix memory leak when loading a level? maybe the custom audio buffers?
	· Fix the side flames.
	· Detonator usage doesn't work.
	· Fix rain maybe.
	· Fix boat sound.
	· Fix compys.
	· Fix the quadbike sound sync.
	· Fix minecart sound.
	· Fix death animation not being played in minecart.
	· Because all objects have 1 animation with at least 1 frame we may tweak that at some point but for now we will just load the object because it will be used for meshswap.
	
- Ideas.
