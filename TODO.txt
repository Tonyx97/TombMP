- General bugs, issues and new features:
	· Load/unload of audios when starting/stopping a resource that register them.
	· Fix the side flames.
	· Detonator usage doesn't work.
	· Fix rain maybe.
	· Fix boat sound.
	· Fix the quadbike sound sync.
	· Fix minecart sound.
	· Fix death animation not being played in minecart.
	· Fix not dying in minecart properly.
	· Because all objects need 1 animation with at least 1 frame to be properly rendered we may tweak that at some point but for now we will just load the object because it will be used for meshswap.
	
- Ideas.
	· Add more inventory scripting functions and events, so we can like press a key and drop an item etc.
	· Gamemode where you spawn several rats in arena and players need to survive xd.
	· Add prop hunt gamemode.
	· Add enemies replace lara gamemode (suggested by member in last event).
	· Add ability to disable lara's hair.
	· Add a pet :o.
	· Experiment with physics in limbs.

- v1.0.6:
	· Sometimes the AI death anim aren't fully synced and they get stuck in the middle.
	
- v1.1.x:
